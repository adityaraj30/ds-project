This repository consists of two parts

## Demo 1 

The source code for Demo 1 located at src/Dem1Pack.

This demo consists of three multi layered transportation network graphs.  <br>

Dataset File Names:- <br>
1. "G1.txt" - Roadways
2. "G2.txt" - Railways
3. "G3.txt" - Airways<br>

Datasets are under the main project folder.

There is also a fourth file ("GraphList.txt") which consists of the names of the files which need to be inputted.
If more graphs need to be added, add the file to the main project folder and insert the name of 
the file into the "GraphList.txt" file.

Algorithms Used (Taken from Princeton CS Algorithms Website) - 
- Prim's MST
- Kruskal's MST
- Dijkstra's SP
- Bellman Ford SP

Key - 
- Avg - Average
- Med - Median
- Min - Minimum
- Max - Maximum


## Demo 2

The source code for Demo 2 located at src/Dem2Pack.

This demo consists of Web Pages on Facebook  <br>

Dataset File Names:- <br> 
1. "musae_facebook_edges.txt"
2. "musae_facebook_edges_2.txt" (used only for converting undirected graph into directed graph for certain programs)

Datasets are under the main project folder.
